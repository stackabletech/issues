## Release checklists

Replace the items in the task lists below with the applicable Pull Requests / Issues

### General Pre-Requisites (before Feature Freeze)

> [!TIP]
> These tasks should be done earlier in the process to lessen the burden at Pre-release time.

```[tasklist]
### Early Pre-release tasks
- [ ] [Create a "Release Retro" issue](https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/new?template=08-release-retro.md)
- [ ] Define product versions to include in the next release
- [ ] [Update and release operator-rs workspace members](https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/issues/new?template=release-workspace-members.md)
- [ ] [Update Rust toolchain of operators](https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-templating/issues/new?template=pre-release.md)
- [ ] [Update Rust dependencies of operators](https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/new?template=05-pre-release-operator-rust-deps.md)
- [ ] [Major or Minor Container Images updates](https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/issues/new?template=early-pre-release.md)
- [ ] [Patch Container Images updates](https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/issues/new?template=early-pre-release.md)
```

> [!TIP]
> These tasks should be done a week or so before the release date.

```[tasklist]
### Pre-release
- [ ] Run all of the test suites in Jenkins (with all product versions, not just "nightly")
- [ ] [Check and update getting-started scripts](https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/new?template=03-pre-release-getting-started-scripts.md)
- [ ] [Check and update demo charts](https://github.com/stackabletech/demos/issues/new?template=pre-release-chart-updates.md)
- [ ] [Test demos and upgrade from stable to nightly release](https://github.com/stackabletech/demos/issues/new?template=pre-release-upgrade-testing.md)
- [ ] Ensure integration tests are successful on OpenShift (run with `--test-suite openshift` against Replicated OKD)
- [ ] Check stackable-utils scripts in dry-run mode work
```

### Other Pre-Requisites (before Feature Freeze)

Search for open issues labeleded with [`scheduled-for/YY.M.X`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Astackabletech+label%3Ascheduled-for%2FYY.M.X&type=issues&state=open)

```[tasklist]
### Other release-specific pre-requisites
- [ ] Run `niv update` and test via `make run-dev` (operator-templating)
```

### Feature freeze

This will not be so crucial with release branches, but is nonetheless sensible as it will make it easier to cherry-pick any release-related bugfixes from main into the release branch.

### End of the release cycle (Release day)

```[tasklist]
#### Technical tasks
- [ ] Create release branch for docker-images (see stackable-utils for script to create branches)

- [ ] _Wait for images to be built_
- [ ] [Check and update getting-started scripts](https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/new?template=07-release-getting-started-scripts.md) for the Release Candidate

- [ ] Create release tag(s) for docker-images (see stackable-utils for scripts to create tags)
- [ ] Create release tag(s) for operators (see stackable-utils for scripts to create tags)
- [ ] Update release version in changelogs on main branches (see stackable-utils for script to do this)

- [ ] [Test demos and upgrade from previous to this release](https://github.com/stackabletech/demos/issues/new?template=release-upgrade-testing.md)
- [ ] Check that an upgrade can be performed on an existing cluster without data loss (cycling demo)
- [ ] Run all integration tests (for both `x86_64` and ~`aarch64`~ (defer aarch64 until interu is used))
- [ ] Ensure integration tests are successful on OpenShift (run with `--test-suite openshift` against Replicated OKD)
- [ ] Release stackablectl
```

> [!TIP]
> Name the release-notes branch `docs/release-notes-YY.M.X` so that the link below takes you directly to the [Pull Request template][docs-pr-template].

[docs-pr-template]: https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/tree/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/release-notes.md&title=chore(tracking):%20Release%20Notes%20for%20SDP%20YY.M.X

```[tasklist]

- [ ] Compile list of new product features in newly supported versions for the YY.M.X release (for the blog post)
- [ ] Begin writing the release notes with the [Pull Request template](https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/compare/main...docs/release-notes-YY.M.X?template=release-notes.md&title=chore(tracking):%20Release%20Notes%20for%20SDP%20YY.M.X)
- [ ] Update SDP release version in `documentation/modules/ROOT/pages/getting-started.adoc` and test the release install command

- [ ] Update releases in the playbook (see [scripts/publish-new-version.sh](https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/blob/main/scripts/publish-new-version.sh))
- [ ] Remove any references to HEAD and main from the Antora playbooks on the release branch (replace with the release branch)
- [ ] Update antora.yaml version in stackabletech/demos on the release branch - the stackable-utils release-scripts should do this like they do for products and operators.
- [ ] Set the release to "Released" in the Feature Tracker and create a new release (ping @lfrancke)
- [ ] Update the getting-started page in the main docs and check it works with this release: https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/blob/main/modules/ROOT/pages/getting-started.adoc
