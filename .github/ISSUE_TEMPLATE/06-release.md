> [!IMPORTANT]
> Important dates:
>
> - ... - Release planning
> - ... - Lock product versions
> - ... - Final operator-rs release at CoB
> - ... - Begin bumping operator-rs crates in each operator
> - ... - Begin release-branching tasks
> - ... - Target release date (marketable)

> [!TIP]
> Replace the items in the task lists below with the applicable Pull Requests / Issues.

## Early Pre-release tasks

> [!TIP]
> These tasks should be done earlier in the process to lessen the burden at Pre-release time.

- [ ] [Create a "Release Retro" issue][epr-1]
- [ ] Define product versions to include in the next release
- [ ] [Major or Minor Container Images updates][epr-2]
- [ ] [Patch Container Images updates][epr-2] (Do not reuse the previous issue)
- [ ] Run `niv update` and test via `make run-dev` (operator-templating)

[epr-1]: https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/new?template=08-release-retro.md
[epr-2]: https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/issues/new?template=early-pre-release.md

## Pre-release

> [!TIP]
> These tasks should be done a week or so before the release date.

- [ ] [Update and release operator-rs workspace members][pr-1]
- [ ] [Update Rust toolchain of operators][pr-2]
- [ ] [Update Rust dependencies of operators][pr-3]
- [ ] Run all of the test suites in Jenkins (with all product versions, not just "nightly")
- [ ] [Check and update getting-started scripts][pr-4]
- [ ] [Check and update demo charts][pr-5]
- [ ] [Test demo upgrades (stable to nightly)][pr-6]
- [ ] [Test demos from scratch (nightly)][pr-7]
- [ ] Ensure integration tests are successful on OpenShift (run with `--test-suite openshift` against Replicated OKD)
- [ ] Check [stackable-utils] scripts in dry-run mode work
- [ ] Search for open issues labeled with [scheduled-for/YY.M.X][pr-8]

## Release branching

> [!CAUTION]
> A small change freeze is required until these tasks have been completed.

> [!TIP]
> See [stackable-utils] for script to create tags and update changelogs.

- [ ] Create release branch for docker-images
- [ ] Create release branches for operators
- [ ] Create release branch for demos
- [ ] _Wait for images to be built before proceeding_

## Release candidate testing

> [!WARNING]
> To be discussed during the on-site.
>
> Getting started scripts use particular product versions (this would have been updated in the
> early-pre-release stage), however, at this point in time, the images will be tagged with an rcX
> tag.

<!--

> [!TIP]
> As issues are discovered, they can be fixed on the `main` branch, and cherry-picked into the release branch.
>
> Please ensure the changelog is updated and correct for the release after cherry-picking changes.
> Please also keep PR links as they are in `main` (do not update them for the cherry-picked PR).

- [ ] [Check and update getting-started scripts](https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/new?template=07-release-getting-started-scripts.md) for the Release Candidate
- [ ] [Test demos and upgrade from previous to this release](https://github.com/stackabletech/demos/issues/new?template=release-upgrade-testing.md) for Release Candidate (only fresh install)

-->

## Release tagging

> [!TIP]
> See [stackable-utils] for script to create tags and update changelogs.

- [ ] Create release tag(s) for docker-images
- [ ] Create release tag(s) for operators
- [ ] Update release version in changelogs on main branches
- [ ] _Wait for images to be built before proceeding_
- [ ] Test `stackablectl` with locally updated (to new release number) `releases.yaml`
- [ ] Update [release.yaml](https://github.com/stackabletech/release/blob/main/releases.yaml)
- [ ] Release stackablectl

## Release verification

> [!TIP]
> These tasks do not block the Documentation tasks below and can be done concurrently.

- [ ] [Check getting-started scripts][rv-1]
- [ ] [Test demos from scratch (YY.M.X)][rv-2]
- [ ] Check that an upgrade can be performed on an existing cluster without data loss (cycling demo)
- [ ] Run all integration tests (for both `x86_64` and ~`aarch64`~ (defer aarch64 until interu is used))
- [ ] Ensure integration tests are successful on OpenShift (run with `--test-suite openshift` against Replicated OKD)

- [ ] Generate CRD docs [website][dt-1] for the new release by following these [instructions][dt-2]
- [ ] Create a stackabletech/documentation branch called `docs/release-notes-YY.M.X`

- [ ] Remove any references to HEAD and main from the Antora playbooks on the release branch (replace with the release branch)
