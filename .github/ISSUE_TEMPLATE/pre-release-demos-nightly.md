## Pre-Release Demo Testing on Nightly

Part of <https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/TRACKING_ISSUE>

For each demo, run the following commands:

> [!NOTE]

```shell
# Install demo (stable)
stackablectl demo install <DEMO_NAME>

# Get a list of installed operators
stackablectl operator installed --output=plain

# --- OPTIONAL ---
# Sometimes it is necessary to upgrade Helm charts. Look for other Helm Charts
# which might need updating.

# First, see which charts are installed. You can ignore the stackable-operator
# charts, or anything that might have been installed outside of this demo.
helm list

# Next, add the applicable Helm Chart repositories. For example:
helm repo add minio https://charts.min.io/
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

# Finally, upgrade the Charts. For example:
helm upgrade minio minio/minio --version x.x.x
helm upgrade postgresql-hive bitnami/postgresql --version x.x.x
# --- OPTIONAL END ---

# Uninstall operators
stackablectl release uninstall <CURRENT_RELEASE>

# Update CRDs to nightly version (on main)
# Repeat this for every operator used by the demo
kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/commons-operator/main/deploy/helm/commons-operator/crds/crds.yaml
kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/...-operator/main/deploy/helm/...-operator/crds/crds.yaml

# Install nightly version of operators (use the list from the earlier step
# before deleting the operators)
stackablectl operator install commons ...

# Optionally update the product versions in the CRDs, e.g.:
kubectl patch hbaseclusters/hbase --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/image/productVersion", "value":"x.x.x"}]' # changed

```
