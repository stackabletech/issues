## Pre-Release Demo Testing on Nightly

Part of <https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/TRACKING_ISSUE>

> [!CAUTION]
> Ensure the [`next` branch is merged to `main`][1], otherwise you will be testing based on old product versions.
>
> This is needed until [stackablectl can deploy demos for a release][2].
>
> [1]: https://github.com/stackabletech/demos/compare/main...next
> [2]: https://github.com/stackabletech/stackable-cockpit/issues/310

This is testing:

1. The demos documented in nightly (with the updated product versions) still work.
2. That the operators can be upgraded from the current release to the nightly release and do not negatively impact the products.

> [!NOTE]
> Record any issues or anomalies during the process in a comment on this issue.

<summary>Instructions</summary>

These instructions are for deploying the nightly demo, as well as upgrading the operators and CRDS.

```shell
# Install demo (stable)
stackablectl demo install <DEMO_NAME>

# --- IMPORTANT ---
# Run through the nightly demo instructions (refer to the tasklist below).

# Get a list of installed operators
stackablectl operator installed --output=plain

# --- OPTIONAL ---
# Sometimes it is necessary to upgrade Helm charts. Look for other Helm Charts
# which might need updating.

# First, see which charts are installed. You can ignore the stackable-operator
# charts, or anything that might have been installed outside of this demo.
helm list

# Next, add the applicable Helm Chart repositories. For example:
helm repo add minio https://charts.min.io/
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

# Finally, upgrade the Charts. For example:
helm upgrade minio minio/minio --version x.x.x
helm upgrade postgresql-hive bitnami/postgresql --version x.x.x
# --- OPTIONAL END ---

# Uninstall operators
stackablectl release uninstall <CURRENT_RELEASE>

# Update CRDs to nightly version (on main)
# Repeat this for every operator used by the demo
kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/commons-operator/main/deploy/helm/commons-operator/crds/crds.yaml
kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/...-operator/main/deploy/helm/...-operator/crds/crds.yaml

# Install nightly version of operators (use the list from the earlier step
# before deleting the operators)
stackablectl operator install commons ...

# Optionally update the product versions in the CRDs, e.g.:
kubectl patch hbaseclusters/hbase --type='json' -p='[{"op": "replace", "path": "/spec/image/productVersion", "value":"x.x.x"}]' # changed
```
