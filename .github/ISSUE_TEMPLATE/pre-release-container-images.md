This issue tracks the product versions and the changes we need to do to them in our SDP release XX.XX.

The single source of truth for this data is a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uR6nJR3nMxSI51dPFbVJTqA4R3p7UkGU5acrXJNOyNQ/edit#gid=866098130) we filled colaboratively in a planning meeting.

## Acceptance 

We want to bump old and new product versions with the latest ubi image releases.
This includes our [Java base image](https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/tree/main/java-base) which should be done before updating any Java based products.
It also includes bumping to the latest supported JVM version.

### Base images

> [!TIP]
> The Rust upgrades should be done as and when needed by developers, rather than being tied to the product selection for a release.
> Also, ensure `make run-dev` works before bumping the Rust version across the operators.
