This issue tracks the product versions and the changes we need to do to them in our SDP release XX.XX.

The single source of truth for this data is a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uR6nJR3nMxSI51dPFbVJTqA4R3p7UkGU5acrXJNOyNQ/edit#gid=866098130) we filled colaboratively in a planning meeting.

## Acceptance 

These high level tasks need to be completed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At the end, these should be checked based on the more granular criterea for each product/image below.

- [ ] Bump UBI Image releases.
- [ ] Update `versions.py` to reflect the agreed upon versions in the spreadsheet.
- [ ] Update product version references in getting_started docs, kuttl tests, and demos.
- [ ] Update the Stackable DB.

### Base images

> [!TIP]
> The Rust upgrades should be done as and when needed by developers, rather than being tied to the product selection for a release.
> Also, ensure `make run-dev` works before bumping the Rust version across the operators.
