## Operator checklist

This is a generic checklist on things that might have to be done when we start a new Operator.
Not all operators (e.g. internal ones) will need all these points.

- [ ] Enable Operator Templating for the Repo
- [ ] Add it to all Antora documentation playbooks
- [ ] Add it to the documentation sidebar
- [ ] New products should be added to the frontpage of the documentation
- [ ] A Docker image in https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/
