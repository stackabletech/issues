# Stackable Release XXXX-XX

## Release checklists

### Beginning of the release cycle

- [ ] Define product versions to include in the next release
- [ ] Bump Rust version

### Before feature freeze

- [ ] Bump operator-rs to latest version in all operators. This can be done [in this file](https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-templating/blob/main/repositories.yaml) by changing `rust_version`. Please be aware that this action will change it for all repositories at the same time. You may want to test individual operators first.

### Feature freeze

### End of the release cycle (Release day)

#### Technical tasks
- [ ] Bump every operator to the latest operator-rs at some point before the feature freeze (meaning: at least once in the release cycle, and leaving sufficient time for testing etc.)
- [ ] Release operators that are part of the release (if release is needed), see separate checklist below
  - [ ] Set stable operator versions in the `docs/templating_vars.yaml` file before releasing, and back to nightly afterwards
  - [ ] Release the actual operator
  - [ ] Bump the operators to the new -nightly version
- [ ] Integration tests passed
- [ ] Update stackablectl/release.yaml to add the new release
- [ ] Demos updated if required

#### Documentation tasks
- [ ] Create a Changelog including Release Highlights
- [ ] Write an upgrade guide
  - [ ] Document how to use stackablectl to uninstall all and install new release
  - [ ] Document how to use helm to uninstall all and install new release
  - [ ] Every breaking change of all our operators
  - [ ] List dropped supported product versions (if there are some)
  - [ ] List dropped supported operators (if there are some)
  - [ ] List supported k8s versions
- [ ] Bump documentation
  - [ ] Update version of main documentation repo (when it is versioned in the future)

#### Marketing tasks
- [ ] Update the homepage banner (as long as we have it) to point to the new release
- [ ] Write a blogpost announcing the new release (optional)
- [ ] Produce a release highlight video (optional)
