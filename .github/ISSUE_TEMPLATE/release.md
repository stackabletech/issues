# Stackable Release XXXX-XX

## Release checklists

### Beginning of the development cycle directly after the previous release

- [ ] Bump ubi8 base image versions in https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images (it should be possible to do this by merging the latest Renovate PR mentioning ubi8)
- [ ] Bump java base image versions in https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/tree/main/java-base (it should be possible to do this by merging the latest Renovate PR mentioning ubi8)
- [ ] Bump Rust version. This can be done [in this file](https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-templating/blob/main/repositories.yaml) by changing `rust_version`. Please be aware that this action will change it for all repositories at the same time (when merging the templating PRs).
- [ ] Define product versions to include in the next release

### Before feature freeze

- [ ] Bump operator-rs to latest version in all operators. When using release branches, this will usually be the previous platform release version. This should be done early in the release cycle to leave sufficient time for testing etc.

One-off tasks before the first release using release branches:

- [ ] Ensure that versions in the main branches for the the operators have been set to "0.0.0-nightly" (this will remain unchanged in the main branch)
- [ ] Ensure that automatic renovate runs have been disabled and do it manually once (or more if needed) at the beginning of the dev cycle (we update the dependencies *after the release is complete* in the *main* branch - never in release branches)

### Feature freeze

This will not be so crucial as we are using release branches, but is nonetheless sensible as it will make it easier to cherry-pick any release-related bugfixes from main into the release branch.

### End of the release cycle (Release day)
