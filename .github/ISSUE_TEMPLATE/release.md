# Stackable Release XXXX-XX

## Release checklists

### General pre-requisites (before feature freeze)

- [ ] Run renovate manually
- [ ] Check/bump ubi8 base image (it should be possible to do this by merging the latest Renovate PR mentioning ubi8)
- [ ] Check/bump java base image (it should be possible to do this by merging the latest Renovate PR mentioning ubi8)
- [ ] Check/bump the vector base image
- [ ] Check/bump the stackable base image
- [ ] Bump Rust version. This can be done [in this file](https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-templating/blob/main/repositories.yaml) by changing `rust_version` and also for the ubi base iamge [here](https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/blob/main/ubi8-rust-builder/Dockerfile#L25). Please be aware that this action will change it for all repositories at the same time (when merging the templating PRs).
- [ ] Define product versions to include in the next release
- [ ] Bump operator-rs to latest version in all operators. This should be done early in the release cycle to leave sufficient time for testing etc.
- [ ] Run getting-started scripts if they have not yet been incorporated into integration tests

### Other release-specific pre-requisites
- [ ] ...

### Feature freeze

This will not be so crucial with release branches, but is nonetheless sensible as it will make it easier to cherry-pick any release-related bugfixes from main into the release branch.
