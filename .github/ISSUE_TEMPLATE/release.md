# Stackable Release XX.(X)X

## Release checklists

```[tasklist]
### General pre-requisites (before feature freeze)
- [ ] Bump operator-rs to latest version in all operators. This should be done early in the release cycle to leave sufficient time for testing etc.
- [ ] Check Rust and e.g. cargo deps versions
- [ ] Run/check getting-started scripts
- [ ] Run/check demos with dev release and main branch and create draft PR for release-related changes
- [ ] Ensure integration tests are successful on OpenShift
- [ ] Test SDP release upgrade against 2-3 demos (i.e. install release, run demo, bump release, check what needs to be patched)
- [ ] TODO: get rid of this ? Update the getting-started page in the main docs and check it works with this release: https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/blob/main/modules/ROOT/pages/getting_started.adoc
```

```[tasklist]
### Other release-specific pre-requisites
- [ ] ...
```

### Feature freeze

This will not be so crucial with release branches, but is nonetheless sensible as it will make it easier to cherry-pick any release-related bugfixes from main into the release branch.

### End of the release cycle (Release day)
