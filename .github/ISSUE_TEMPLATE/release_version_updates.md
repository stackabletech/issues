This issue tracks the product versions and the changes we need to do to them in our SDP release XX.XX.

The single source of truth for this data is a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uR6nJR3nMxSI51dPFbVJTqA4R3p7UkGU5acrXJNOyNQ/edit#gid=866098130) we filled colaboratively in a planning meeting.

## Acceptance 

We want to bump old and new product versions with the latest ubi image releases. This means bumping the stackable version and rerunning the build actions. This includes our [Java base image](https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/tree/main/java-base) which should be done before updating any Java based products.

### Base images

#### UBI8 Rust Builder

[ubi8-rust-builder](https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/blob/main/ubi8-rust-builder/Dockerfile)

```[tasklist]

### Product Images

- `New` versions need to be added to `conf.py` and added to the documentation page for the operator
- `Deprecated` need to be updated in the documentation
- `Removed` need to be updated in `conf.py` and removed from the documentation page
- Make sure to _also_ check any other dependencies we might use in a Docker image! (e.g. git sync, prometheus exporter etc.)
